This is a Star Trek Trivia quiz in the form of a Starfleet Academy promotion exam. There are 3 levels of play: Ensign (10 questions),
Lieutenant (25 questions) and Commander (50 questions). A passing grade is achieved by answering 80% of the questions offered
correctly. 

This quiz draws from a database of 385 questions. Each question is displayed with four (4) possible answers, only one of which
is correct. Each question is presented with a Catagory and a Description which will guide the player in answering the question.
When the player answers a question, they will immediately be informed as to whether the question was answerd corectly or incorrectly.
They will also be provided with the correct answer and a narrative about the correct answer.

Once the exam is over (all questions have been answered), the player will be informed whether or not they passed and the percentage
of questions answered correctly. An option to review incorrectly answered questions will be provided. This will allow the player
to review a page of information (from MemoryAlpha.com). Not all pages displayed will have information about the question at the
top of the page. If this information is not immediately visible, the player should press Ctrl+F on their keyboard and enter a
keyword to search for the information. For example, if the question was regarding Ferengi Rule of Acquisition #3, the link will
take the player to the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition page on MemoryAlpha.com, and the user may press Ctrl+F and search for the
keyword "Rule #3" which will locate the specific information for that rule of acquisition.
